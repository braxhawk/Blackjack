# Blackjack

We aim to create an accessible blackjack game:

The goal of the game is to add playing card values to get as close to, without exceeding, 21 against a Dealer. Players can choose to draw a card or pass by using the "hit" or "stand" buttons. While also being a widely popular game, players can also strengthen their mental math and critical thinking skills. 

The game is fully compatible with macOS VoiceOver. Additionally it has a simple user interface with extra large buttons and text, as well as high contrast, for low-vision users. Enable VoiceOver using Cmd-FN5 keys. 

Our project is still in progress, but a demo can be viewed here:
