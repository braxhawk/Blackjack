# Blackjack

We aim to create an accessible blackjack game:

The goal of the game is to add playing card values to get as close to, without exceeding, 21 against a Dealer. Players can choose to draw a card or pass by using the "hit" or "stand" buttons. While also being a widely popular game, players can also strengthen their mental math and critical thinking skills. Learn how to play here: http://www.hitorstand.net/strategy.php.

**The game is fully compatible with macOS & iOS VoiceOver, as well as Chrome's ChromeVox. There is also optional text-to-speech capability. Additionally, it has a simple user interface with extra large buttons and text, as well as high contrast. For more detail, see the provided Report.md.**
