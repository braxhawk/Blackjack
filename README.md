# Blackjack

We aim to create an accessible, fully VoiceOver compatible, blackjack game for visually impaired users:

Our project is still in progress, but a demo can be viewed here:

Instructions for how the game operates is on the game's homepage. In short, the game uses VoiceOver functionality provided by Apple to play a simple game of BlackJack. At the menu, you will be asked to imput your name, and then (eventualy once debugged) select a game mode depending on how difficult you want it to be to win!
